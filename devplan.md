## Introduction:

Top-down dungeon-crawler 2D trap adventure game. Play as a frog trying to find its way home. The path is filled with non-obvious traps with a glitch: some of them don’t always activate, adding another layer of suspense to the player. Player wins when the frog gets home, and is welcomed with a pleasant surprise.

"“Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself when apparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by much, than the evil which we are anxious about...” - Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe.


## Game Design:

1. Specifications:

    - Engine & Programming Language: Processing - Java

- Map creation: Create an end-to-end map. Map has 1 path to the end with some hidden paths leading to rewards or keys… (depends on task systems in iteration 3).
- Player movement:
- Collision Detection:
    - Trigger (Soft Collision): taps, pressure plate, floor tiles, item, end goal
    - hard Collision: Walls, immovanle objects
    - Can incorporate multiple conditions to add subtlety
    - End goal: 
        - Display winning screen
    
- Collision Detection: Detect collisions between players and other objects (walls, floor, traps)
